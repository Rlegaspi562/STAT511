# Assignment Questions

--------------------



## __1. KNN 4th Edition End of Chapter 1 Questions__ 
 *In a regression model, $\beta_{0}$ = 100, $\beta_{1}$ = 20, and $\sigma^2$ = 25. An observation on 𝑌 variable will be made for 𝑋 = 5.*

<div align="center">

$Y_{i}$ = $\beta_{0}$ *(intercept)* + $\beta_{1}$$X_{i}$ _(slope)(independent variable)_ + $\epsilon_{i}$ _(error)_

</div>
<div align="center">

y = 100 + 20$X_{i}$ + $\epsilon_{i}$

</div>
#### (a). Can we compute the exact probability that 𝑌 will fall between 195 and 205? Explain

__The probability cannot be calculated because the for a simple linear regression model the mean of $\epsilon_{i}$ should equal 0. Because $\epsilon_{i}$ is unspecified we are missing information and cannot compute the exact probability.__

#### (b). If the normal error regression model is applicable, can we now compute the exact probability that 𝑌 will fall between 195 and 205? If so, compute it.

*note: $\epsilon_{i}$ (error term) = 0 and follows a normal distribution*

For this problem we recall:

* 1. The Z score formula since we are dealing with a normal distribution. 
$\frac{X - \mu}{\sigma}$
* 2. How to find the probability between 2 points given a normal distribution.

*(aka find the z score which finds everything from the left and subtract it by the larger number to get the probability between a and b)*

* 3. And that we are also given $\sigma^2 = 25$ *(variance)* and $\sigma = 5$ *(Standard deviation)*


<div align="center">
SO: $P( 195 \leq  Y \leq  205) = P(\frac{195 - 200}{5}\leq \frac{X - \mu}{\sigma} \leq \frac{205 - 200}{5})$

$= P(-1 \leq z\leq 1)$

$= P(z < 1) - P(z<-1)$      _bigger number or b is P(z < 1)_

$= 0.841 - 0.158$           _converting numbers using pos/neg z table_

$= 0.683$

__The probability that Y will fall between the 195 and 205 is roughly 0.683.__
</div>

## __2. Grade Point Average Problem (Use R)__

_The director of admissions of a small college selected 120 students at random from the new
freshman class in a study to determine whether a student's grade point average (GPA) at the end 
of the freshman year (𝑌) can be predicted from the ACT test score (𝑋). See the dataset “GPA.txt”. The first column is GPA. The second column is ACT._
```{r, include=TRUE}

setwd("C:/Users/RUMIL/Desktop/APU/STAT 511 - Millie Mao (Applied Regression Analysis)/R Files/STAT 511")


gpa_data = read.table(file = "GPA.txt", header = FALSE, sep = "")
head(gpa_data)
#No headers, so we add
names(gpa_data) <- c("GPA", "ACT Score")
head(gpa_data)

#scatterplot
plot(gpa_data)

```


#### (a). Obtain the least squares estimates of $\beta_{0}$ and $\beta_{1}$. Write down the estimated regression equation.
```{r}
lm(`ACT Score`~ GPA, data = gpa_data)
gpa_lm = lm(`ACT Score`~ GPA, data = gpa_data)
summary(gpa_lm)

plot(gpa_lm)
```

#### (b). Plot the estimated regression line and the data points. Does the estimated regression function appear to fit the data well?

#### (c). Obtain a point estimate of the mean freshman GPA for students with ACT test score 𝑋 = 30.

#### (d). What is the estimated change in the mean response when the ACT score increases by one point?

---------------------

## __3. Refer to the GPA problem in Question 2. (Use R)__

#### (a). Obtain the residuals $\hat{\epsilon_1}$. Do they sum to zero?

#### (b). Estimate the error variance $\sigma^2$ and standard deviation $\sigma$. In what units is $\sigma$ expressed?

-------------------------


## __4. Refer to the GPA problem in Question 2.__

#### (a).  Interpret $\hat{\epsilon_0}$ in your estimated regression function. Does $\hat{\epsilon_0}$ provide any relevant information here? Explain.

#### (b). Interpret $\hat{\epsilon_1}$ in your estimated regression function. 

#### (c). Verify that your fitted regression line goes through the point ($\bar{𝑋}$ , $\bar{𝑌}$). (Use R)


-------------------------

## __5. Muscle Mass Problem (Use R)__
_A person’s muscle mass is expected to decrease with age. To explore this relationship in women,
a nutritionist randomly selected 15 women from each l0-year age group, beginning with age 40
and ending with age 79. 𝑋 is age, and 𝑌 is a measure of muscle mass. See the dataset “Muscle.txt”.
The first column is muscle mass. The second column is women’s age._

#### (a). Obtain the estimated regression equation. 

#### (b). Interpret $\beta_{0}$ in your estimated regression function. Does $\beta_{0}$ provide any relevant information here? Explain.

#### (c). Interpret $\hat{\beta_1}$ in your estimated regression function. 

#### (d). Plot the estimated regression function and the data points. Does a linear regression function appear to give a good fit here? Does your plot support that muscle mass decreases with age?

#### (e).  Obtain a point estimate of the difference in the mean muscle mass for women differing in age by one year.

#### (f). Obtain a point estimate of the mean muscle mass for women aged 𝑋 = 60 years.

#### (g). Find the estimate of error variance $\sigma^2$

-------------------------

## __6. Special regression models__

#### (a). What is the implication for the regression model $Y_{i}$ = $\beta_{0}$ + $\epsilon_{i}$ ? How does it plot on a graph?

#### (b). What is the implication for the regression model $Y_{i}$ = $\beta_{1}$$X_{i}$ + $\epsilon_{i}$ ? How does it plot on a graph?
