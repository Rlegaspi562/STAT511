# **Purpose**

We are conducting a multiple linear regression model from the Real Estate Sales (APPENC07) dataset to analyze the relationship of the given features, bedrooms, bathrooms, and garage size, with the outcome variable, house sales price in a midwestern city.

# **Our Data**

## Background on dataset and variables

Our dataset is comprised of 522 total transactions from home sales during the year 2002.

#Using the lm function to fit a multiple regression model
house_lm <- lm(house_price ~ beds + baths + garage_size, data = house_data)

#Regression summary

```

## Interpretation of coefficients

### Intercept & Partial Slopes

From summarizing our multiple linear regression model we can see:

| **Intercept** | Bedrooms    | Bathrooms   | Garage Size |
|---------------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| $\beta_{0}$   | $\beta_{1}$ | $\beta_{2}$ | $\beta_{3}$ |
| -45886.3      | 935.4       | 67818.9     | 67332.3     |

and the estimated regression equation to be:

$\hat{Y}= -45886.3 + 935.4X + 67818.9X + 67332.3X$

The partial slopes in our summary indicate that when any one of the partial slopes **Increase by 1 unit** and other explanatory variables held constant and unchanged we can expect:

-   When holding our other explanatory variables Bathrooms and Garage Size constant and unchanged, when **Bedrooms** increases by 1 unit, we can expect our **house sales price** to increase by **roughly \$935.4**.

-   When holding our other explanatory variables Bedrooms and Garage Size constant and unchanged, when **Bathrooms** increases by 1 unit, we can expect our **house sales price** to increase by **roughly \$67,818.9.**

-   When holding our other explanatory variables Bedrooms and Bathrooms constant and unchanged, when **Garage size** increases by 1 unit, we can expect our **house sales price** to increase by **roughly \$67332.3**.

### Adjusted R-Squared = 0.54

A adjusted R squared value similar to the R square value tells us how much of the variability in our model is explained by our predictor variables, but also penalizes redundant or otherwise useless predictor variables helping us to resist urges of adding too many variables into our model.

In this case our adjusted \$R\^2\$ of 0.54 tells us that about 54% of the variation in our response variable is explained by our 3 explanatory variables.

# Part 2 - Prediction

## Predicting the house sales price for a house with 3 bedrooms, 3 bathrooms, and a 2-car garage

```{r}
#Creating a observation where a given house has 
#3 Bedrooms, 3 Bathrooms, and a 2 car garage
new_house_data <- data.frame(beds = 3, baths = 3, garage_size = 2)
```

### Calculating the 95% confidence interval

```{r}
#confidence interval
ci_house <- predict(house_lm, new_house_data, interval = "confidence", level = 0.95)
ci_house
```

### Calculating the 95% prediction interval

```{r}
#prediction interval
pi_house <- predict(house_lm, new_house_data, interval = "prediction", level = 0.95)
pi_house
```

# Part 3 - Hypothesis Testing

### 3a. Conducting a hypothesis test for each individual partial slope (independent variable) to check for significance using a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$

**Null Hypothesis**: ${H_0}$: $\beta_{j} = 0$ (slopes are showing no change), $X_{j}$ **is not** linearly associated with Y, therefore the partial slope **is not significant.**

**Alternative Hypothesis**: ${H_1}$: $\beta_{j} \neq 0$ (slopes are showing change), $X_{j}$ **is** linearly associated with Y, therefore the partial slope **is significant.**

+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Bedrooms ($X_{1}$)             | Bathrooms ($X_{2}$)             | Garage Size ($X_{3}$)           |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| 0.8507 **\>** $\alpha = 0.05%$ | \<2e-16 **\<** $\alpha = 0.05%$ | \<2e-16 **\<** $\alpha = 0.05%$ |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Fail to reject ${H_0}$         | Reject ${H_0}$                  | Reject ${H_0}$                  |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
| Not Significant                | Significant                     | Significant                     |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+
|                                |                                 |                                 |
+--------------------------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+

: Table Representation of Hypothesis Testing

**Bedroom variable:**

The p-value of Bedroom is 0.8507 and is greater than our $\alpha$ (accepted error) of 0.05, so we **fail to reject** our NULL hypothesis and must conclude with our NULL hypothesis. Stating that our partial slope, **Bedrooms**, does not show overall significance in our model.

**Bathroom & Garage Size variables:**

On the other hand because the p-value of Bathroom and Garage size are both \<2e-16 and are incredibly smaller than our $\alpha$ (accepted error) of 0.05, so we **reject** our NULL hypothesis and conclude with our alternative hypothesis. Our alternative hypothesis states that our partial slopes, **Bathroom and Garage Size**, shows overall significance in our model.

### 3b. Conducting an F-test to check overall model significance with a significance level of $\alpha = 0.05$

**Null Hypothesis**: ${H_0}$: $\beta_{1}=\beta_{2} = 0$ (**No** partial slopes are significant). Shows no change, therefore **does not** show overall model significance.

**Alternative Hypothesis**: ${H_1}$: $\beta_{1}=\beta_{2} \neq 0$ (**At least one** partial slope is significant). Shows change, therefore **showing** overall model significance

```{r}
#We can use the qt() to find our critical value and compare with our t-value (test statistic)
# We use 0.95 Because of our 95% confidence interval and 518 for our degrees of freedom
qt(0.975, 518)

#Checking for our f-value 
anova(house_lm)
```

| Test Statistic Type & Result | Bedrooms ($X_{1}$) | Bathrooms ($X_{2}$) | Garage Size ($X_{3}$) |
+==============================+====================+=====================+=======================+

+------------------------------+--------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+

+------------------------------+--------------------+---------------------+-----------------------+

: Table Representation of F-test Hypothesis Testing

Our p-value of \< 2.2e-16 being less than our alpha and our F values being larger then our critical value tells us we can reject our NULL hypothesis and conclude with our alternative hypothesis, that **at least one** of our predictor variables **shows** overall model significance.

### Partial F tests

We will be conducting partial F tests to see if the number of bathrooms (X2) and garage size(X3) are jointly significant using a significance level of 0.05.

\*\* In other words is there significance in adding bathrooms and garage size into our model?

\*\* is it comparing full model (y=b0+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3) to (y=b0+b1X1)

or comparing full model (y=b0+b1X1+b2X2+b3X3) to (y=b0+b1x1+b2X2) and (y=b0+b1x1+b3X3)?

```{r}
#Performing partial f-tests
#Creating our reduced models

#model without 
bed_lm(house_lm ~ beds, data = house_data)
full_lm <- house_lm
```

We now compare our reduced model with our complete model

```{r}
anova()
```

In effect, we are concluding that these predictors do contribute information in the prediction of house sales price and therefore should be retained in the model.

# \*\*Part 4 - Multicolinearity

## Creating scatterplots and correlation matrices

```{r}
#Plotting a scatterplot matrix **(why does it look symmterical?)
scat_matrix <- c(beds, baths, garage_size) %>% 
  data.frame() %>%
  plot()

scat_matrix

#Correlation Matrix
corr_matrix <- c(beds, baths, garage_size) %>% 
  data.frame() %>% 
  cor()

corr_matrix

ggcorr_matrix <- ggcorrplot(corr_matrix, hc.order = TRUE, type = "lower", lab = TRUE,
   outline.col = "white",
   ggtheme = ggplot2::theme_gray,
   colors = c("#6D9EC1", "white", "#E46726"))

#Printing both matrices
scat_matrix
ggcorr_matrix

```

The correlation coefficient shows a moderately positive relationship between most of our predictor variables. Moreover, it does not necessarily look like

Having multicolinearity is problematic because by having multiple predictor variables, it becomes harder for our model to attribute significance to. It creates reduNdant information and thereby negatively affecting the results of our regression model.

A way to combat this is by removing a highly correlated predictor.

```{r}
vif(house_lm)

#summary
summary(house_lm)

#removing baths
nobath_lm <- lm(house_price ~ beds + garage_size, data = house_data)

summary(nobath_lm)

nogarage_lm <- lm(house_price ~ beds + baths, data = house_data)

summary(nogarage_lm)
```

\*\*By putting myself in the shoes of a home buyer, a garage size might not hold as much priority over bedrooms and bathrooms when in the process of buying a home. Additionally, By removing garage size we have adjusted for multicolinearity and are now able to see the
