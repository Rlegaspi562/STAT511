From summarizing our  Multiple Linear Regression model we can see:

and the estimated regression equation to be:

__$\hat{Y}= -68.8571 + -1.4546X + 9.3655X$__


__$\beta_{0}$ = -68.8571 _(intercept)_ __

interpretation: When target population and disposable income is both 0 the sales of the portait will be bankrupt and be at a deficit of -68 thousand dollars. Makes sense and does not makes sense

__$\beta_{1}$ = 1.4546 _(slope)_ __

Interpretation: holding dispoinc constand and unchanged 

__$\beta_{2}$ = 9.3655 _(slope)_ __

Interpretation: Holding target popo constant and unchanged when disploable income increase by 1 thousand dollars sales increase by 1 thousand dollars

residuals variance equal residual std err but squared

#R Squared and Adjusted R Squared, Constructing a Confidence interval
```{r}
summary(sales.lm)
```
1. Multiple R^2 = 0.9167; Adjusted R^2 = 0.9075
 
Interpretation: Multiple R^2 explains to us that 91% of the variability in Y is collectively explained by our two X variables, disposable income and target population.
 
Adjust R^2 tells us that 90& of the variability in Y is collectively explained by our two variables while penalizes explanatory variables that are redundant and irrelevant.

2. Conducting Test for overall model significance

```{r}
#alpha at 0.05
alpha <- 0.05


#constructing our 95% confidence interval
confint(sales.lm, level = 1 - alpha)
confint(sales.lm)
```

__Null Hypothesis__: ${H_0}$: $\beta_{1}=\beta_{2} = 0$ (slopes are showing no change), in other words show no overall model significance between our partial slopes.

__Alternative Hypothesis__: ${H_1}$: $\beta_{1}=\beta_{2} \neq 0$ (slopes are showing change), in other words show overall model significance between our partial slopes.

Using P value or critical value (F Statistic larger than critical value)
P-value = 1.921e-10
F Statistic = 99.1
