# STAT511
## A place for STAT511 files, assignmnents and projects.

### Im testing out R notebooks so these should be some pretty janky looking iterations of my rmd files. 

### Currently just saving the preview.rmd because I knit those into PDF's to turn in.

### My workflow process definitely needs improvement, so if you are reading this (hello, welcome, and thank you) and _feel free to give out any suggestions :)_
