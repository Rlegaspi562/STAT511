# STAT511
## A place for STAT511 files, assignments and projects in R.

### Im testing out R notebooks so these should be some pretty janky looking iterations of my rmd files. 

### Currently just saving the preview.rmd because I knit those into PDF's reports to turn in.

### My workflow process definitely needs improvement, so if you are reading this (hello, welcome, and thank you) and _feel free to give out any suggestions :)_

#### To Note:
  - ".rmd" - The R code in markdown format
  - ".pdf" or ".nb.html" - Knitted file in either pdf or html version
  - ".txt" - Typically the dataset
  - ".PNG" - Images
  - ".Rproj" - The entire R project
 
#### Note to self:
In order to save into a work in a new project thats connected to github
1. Open the github repo file saved locally, it should be titled STAT511-Applied-Regression-work, this project allows you to connect directly with the githhub repo online
2. Create a script, file, markdown file etc.
3. Make some changes and save it. BE SURE TO SAVE IT IN THE FOLDER THAT YOU WANT IT TO BE IN GITHUB
4. Save changes, click the staged box, then commit.
5. When you are ready to finally have it be visible online, PUSH THAT THANG
6. Rinse and repeat, don't forget to comment on commits.
7. Have fun and stay safe, refer to https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLFc9gw_Hfs @ 12:00
