# STAT511
## A place for STAT511 files, assignments and projects in R.

### Im testing out R notebooks so these should be some pretty janky looking iterations of my rmd files. 

### Currently just saving the preview.rmd because I knit those into PDF's reports to turn in.

### My workflow process definitely needs improvement, so if you are reading this (hello, welcome, and thank you) and _feel free to give out any suggestions :)_

#### To Note:
  - ".rmd" - The R code in markdown format
  - ".pdf" or ".nb.html" - Knitted file in either pdf or html version
  - ".txt" - Typically the dataset
  - ".PNG" - Images
  - ".Rproj" - The entire R project
