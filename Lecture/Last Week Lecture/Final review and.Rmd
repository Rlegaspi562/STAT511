1. Multiple Linear Regression with COntinuous Prediction CH. (Read online)

2: Interpretations:
  -intercept bhat 0: estimate mean value of Y is bhat 0 units hwne x1,x2,..., are 0. The relvenancy of intercept
 -  
 f test: for adj r^2 interpretation so say something like: the proportion of the variation (or variatiion) in y jointly by the x variables (regression model)

Partial F test:
compared to overall we are testing which partial slope

interpret the slope when either response variable or predicotr is in natural log. (check midterm review)
